# LLM-Interpretability-Dashboard-w-Ollama-HF-PyTorch-LangChain-CBC-PENN-

LLM Interpretability Workshop where we built a complete dashboard to see what models are actually thinking under the hood.
What we built: Token Probability Analyzer - visualize next-token predictions and probability distributions in real-time Attention Pattern Visualizer - heatmaps showing which tokens models focus on across layers/heads Agent Decision Tracer - step-by-step reasoning traces for LangChain agents using custom callbacks
Tech stack: PyTorch, HuggingFace (phi-2), Ollama (llama3.2), LangChain, Streamlit, Plotly
Everything runs locally, zero API calls. We covered the same interpretability techniques that Anthropic and OpenAI researchers use for mechanistic interpretability and AI safety work—token probability distributions, attention weight extraction, circuit analysis, and agent reasoning traces.
